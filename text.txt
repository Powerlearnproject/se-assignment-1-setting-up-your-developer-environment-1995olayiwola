Setting Up My Development Environment
Assignment: Getting My Coding Space Ready

I'm about to dive into the world of software engineering, and the first step is setting up my development environment. This means getting all the tools and software I need to write, test, and manage my code.

My Plan:

Choosing My Operating System: I'll pick the OS I feel most comfortable with. I'm leaning towards Windows 11 based on the assignment, but I might explore other options.
Picking My Code Editor: I'll download and install Visual Studio Code. It seems like a popular choice with lots of features.
Version Control: Git is the way to go for tracking changes. I'll set it up on my computer and create a GitHub account to store my code online.
Learning the Language: I'll install Python since it's mentioned in the assignment. I might need other languages later, depending on my projects.
Database Setup (Optional): If my projects require storing data, I'll set up MySQL.
Virtual Environments (Optional): To keep things organized and avoid conflicts, I might use tools like Docker to create isolated environments for my projects.
Exploring Extensions: I'll check out the extensions available for Visual Studio Code to make my coding life easier.
Document Everything: I'll create a detailed guide of my setup process, including screenshots. This will help me remember everything and share it with others if needed.
Deliverables:

A step-by-step guide to my setup.
A sample project on GitHub using Git.
A quick write-up about any challenges I faced and how I solved them.
I'm excited to start building my coding workspace! Let's see how this goes.
